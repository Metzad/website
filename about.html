<div class="section" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; margin-top: 50px;">
    <img src="C:\Users\isv61\Downloads\metzad.png" alt="Metzad Image" style="width: 50%; max-width: 400px; height: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <div style="max-width: 800px; text-align: left; margin-top: 20px;">
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">A Jew is a Jew, no matter if they are Ashkenazi, Sephardi, conservative, or liberal. In addition, it is important to point out that, for antisemites around the world, all Jews are viewed as being the same. People who have a strong hatred for others do not care whether a Jew is a Zionist or an anti-Zionist. Throughout history, the Jewish people have faced persecution, and this continues to be true today. The current situation is similar to the challenges they faced in the 1930s and 1940s. Despite the fact that the term "Jew" has been replaced by "Zionist," the animosity persists, and antisemitic tropes are once again being normalized in a multitude of regions of the globe.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">A viewpoint that was previously considered radical is now commonplace in everyday life. The grocer, the hairdresser, the instructor, and even the waitress may now openly express hatred that was previously thought to be limited to a small group of extremists. What is the cause of this? This is because, sadly, hatred has always been a part of human history. According to the Torah, the Jewish people will always have enemies, and we should not be surprised by the reappearance of antisemitism; it is just as much a part of our history as anything else.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Antisemitism did not come to an end with the deaths of Hitler and Stalin. It just changed. There are some nowadays who claim that they do not hate Jews, but simply "Zionists." Some people even go so far as to say that they have Jewish friends who feel the same way they do about anti-Zionism. This is similar to the time when some Jews were used as tokens, called Kapos, during the Nazi government in order to control other Jews. Today's anti-Zionist Jews are just like the Kapos in the 1940s. The distinction between "Zionists" and "Jews" is not a legitimate one; it is merely a modern means of articulating an age-old type of animosity.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Metzad is a Jewish organization that was founded in 2024. It has three primary goals: to inform the world about Zionism, to instruct Jews on how to use firearms responsibly, and to construct a worldwide network of strong Zionists. There is always more work to be done to combat antisemitism, even if we are still in the early stages. We have a number of options available to us, including reporting students who support Hamas, removing anti-Semitic graffiti, and encouraging pro-Israel voices on social media.</p>
        
        <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">As Metzad continues to grow, we intend to offer armed security for Jewish communities, especially during Shabbat services. Every Jew should feel safe and protected in their place of worship. In addition, we want to stage counter-protests against neo-Nazi and radical Islamic gatherings to guarantee that the Jewish community's strength and voice are heard. Zionism is Jewish nationalism, and if you are a proud Zionist, we want you in Metzad. If this message speaks to you, be sure to check us out, and as always, Am Yisrael Chai!</p>
